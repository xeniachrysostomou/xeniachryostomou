					<h2>What is archery?</h2>
					<p>Archery is the sport, practice, or skill of using a bow to shoot arrows. While there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historical and modern), all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string. Bows may be broadly split into two categories: those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string.</p>

					<h3>The benefits of archery</h2>
					<p>The physical, mental and wellbeing benefits of archery. Archery requires focus, strength and determination - Whether you’re a performance athlete or just having a go, archery is great for body and mind. Top archers train daily for many hours at a time, but even for recreational archers, the health benefits of archery are clear. Shooting takes concentration, calming your mind as you focus on the target, and can mean that any worries you have are left aside while at the range.
					</p>
					<ul><li>This focus and ability to concentrate on your technique and the target for those few minutes, can carry through into the rest of your life, allowing you to apply great concentration to tasks, and to put aside anxieties
						</li>
						<li>Drawing your bow requires short bursts of energy from muscles in your chest, hands, arm and upper back muscles, and puts tension on the rotator cuffs, which support your shoulders. As you draw you will hold the tension for a couple of seconds, similar to weightlifting. Repeating these movements as you shoot builds and strengthens these areas, defining the muscles and developing them.
						</li>
						<li>Drawing a bow takes energy, burning calories and toning and strengthening muscles in your arms and back. Walking to the shooting line and then to the target to collect arrows also burns energy and means you’ll get your steps in faster than you think. 
						</li>
					</ul>
